# HOT Humanitarian Data Handbook

# What is this and why?

__This repository is an experiment in using version control ([git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and for the moment [GitHub](https://github.com)) as a default-open management tool within the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://hotosm.org) Humanitarian Data team.__

It is intended to be open by default. By default everything here is default open to _the entire world_ and restricted if needed (personally identifiable, sensitive, or private information).

It is intended to be shared and collaboratively edited by anyone in or outside of the host organization. Why not a wiki, or Google Docs? Mostly on the theory that the fork-and-pull-request workflow of Git strikes a good balance between openness (anyone can fork and/or submit a pull request) and manageability (no one has to accept pull requests, and they're very transparent and reversible).

We've taken some inspiration from [GitLabs' handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/); that company has taken a remarkably open approach to their internal workings, in part in response to some of the same challenges. 

## Humanitarian Data team

This is the division of HOT, under the Director of Humanitarian Data, that is generally responsible for in-person data collection activities undertaken by HOT itself, as opposed to by communities in the larger HOT and humanitarian mapping community.

HOT has a lot of projects on the go that require people to be familiar with some context, people, resources, and documents.

There a great many documents and resources we refer to for our daily work. HOT uses Google Shared Drive for a lot of document storage, but this is far from the only place where critical information may be stored. In some cases documents may be listed that actually live on local machines or hard drives, and are therefore not linked (but at least discoverable for colleagues that may want them and can then ask us for them).
