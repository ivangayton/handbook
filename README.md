# HOT Humanitarian Data Handbook

# What is this and why?

This repository is an experiment in using version control (git, and for the moment GitHub) as a default-open management tool.

It is intended to he desire to be open by default. Rather than the default being a document that requires permission to view, which is opened to others if needed, a document is default open to _the entire world_ and restricted if needed.

inspired by [this](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/); the company GitLab has taken a remarkable open stance with their internal workings. 

## Data/Programs team

This is the division of the team, under the Director of Humanitarian Data, that is generally responsible for in-person data collection activities undertaken by HOT itself, as opposed to by communities in the larger HOT and humanitarian mapping community.

HOT has a lot of projects on the go that require people to be familiar with some context, people, resources, and documents.

There a great many documents and resources we refer to for our daily work. HOT uses Google Shared Drive for a lot of document storage, but this is far from the only place where critical information may be stored. In some cases documents may be listed that actually live on local machines or hard drives, and are therefore not linked (but at least discoverable for colleagues that may want them and can then ask us for them).
