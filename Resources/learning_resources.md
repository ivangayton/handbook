# Learning Resources

## Git
- [FreeCodeCamp's crash Git course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)

## Markdown
- [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), which is probably sufficient to learn how to use Markdown enough to work on a handbook.
