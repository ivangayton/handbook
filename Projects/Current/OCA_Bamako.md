### Documents
The field data collection follows a [Data model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9MwRngkW6fS1O641tFad3ZoWjrtJc5sfrCD0Sv0-UY/edit) that was developed in consulation with the local stakeholders and World Bank team. This should be considered the standard for all data related to the project; any forms or datasets that do not conform to it need to be cleaned, adapted, or re-done!

The HOT Google Drive directory for the project is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1kaRFIcEOvqxRJb5NecieckxNbXhym_bI) (only accessible to people with HOTOSM email accounts). Within this folder is the raw field data as collected in late 2020 and early 2021, in [this subdirectory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O57MJ3IwDkQjDtci7I79fTxaTCuo7GRp?usp=sharing). 

Aaron Eubank's dataviz work is in [a QGIS project hosted on his GitHub account](https://github.com/eubtube/OCA_Bamako_Maps); it can be downloaded to any local computer running QGIS and used.
