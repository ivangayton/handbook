# Proposal for HOT contribution to ODK to improve field data collection

**The humanitarian mapping community has an increasing role in field mapping. Current field mapping tools are fragmented, inconsistent, and don't live up to their potential.**

Let us, as HOT, hire an Android developer and&mdash;together with the [ODK community](https://forum.getodk.org/)&mdash;add a feature set to ODK to improve field data collection!

## What exactly?
Field data collection could be improved in lots of ways, and lots of people _are_ working on it (TODO: add list, including QField, Input, Osmand, Maps.me, etc).

HOT&mdash;and the wider humanitarian mapping community&mdash;have used [OpenMapKit](http://openmapkit.org/) quite a lot, primarily because it allows editing of metadata related to specific feature selected on a map view. Most of the functionality of OMK has already been repatriated into ODK, but a key component, the ability to begin from a map view and select features from which to launch forms, is still missing.

**Adding the capability to have ODK display a map view from the main menu, and launch forms related to features from that map view**, would most likely finally provide all of the functionality that people wanted from OMK.

### Why ODK?
ODK is not the only choice of project/community/toolkit to support, but it's a very good choice because:
- Importance/history of [ODK project](https://getodk.org/) in the humanitarian sector.
- Huge user base, particularly in areas of HOT focus.
- Strong community with open and inclusive values.
- Value of Free Software to community, resource-constrained actors, and [inclusion/justice](https://ivangayton.net/2020/07/03/use-of-proprietary-software-in-the-aid-sector-perpetuates-racial-injustice/).
- Already has most of the required functionality.
- Likely possible to build more utility into ODK but not bend ODK towards a specific use-case or break others' workflows (avoid forks and fragmentation of the project).

### ODK community buy-in

It would not make sense to undertake this without being quite sure that the core ODK community/developers would be on board. 

Fortunately, the basic outline of the proposal has already been extensively discussed with the ODK community, and has encountered a generally supportive response.

- An discussion of the spec for launching forms from map features is [here in this shared doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ICz7gziV-8uiwy_lMDQ5PM_dD_fBmlcJKG_UJsMNUA/edit?usp=sharing) that came out of the ODK summit in Seattle in 2019. 
- [Here's an ODK forum discussion of geo in ODK](https://forum.getodk.org/t/collect-v1-23-offline-vector-basemap-questions/21278/6).
- [Here's a shared doc outlining potential future directions for geo in ODK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBWEOe_KRBldhyy80KuLPGnPM0WxKy6n81bLxGBgNCY/edit?usp=sharing). A lot of this has already been implemented (yay!) but there's more that's possible, and has a good chance of acceptance from the ODK community given the long history of engagement here. This one also contains multiple links to other relevant resources and discussions.
